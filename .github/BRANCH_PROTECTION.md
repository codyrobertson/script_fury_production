# 🔒 BRANCH PROTECTION CONFIGURATION

## 🚨 CRITICAL: GitHub Branch Protection Rules

### **Main Branch (Production) - MAXIMUM SECURITY**

Go to GitHub → Settings → Branches → Add rule for `main`:

#### **Required Settings:**
- ✅ **Restrict pushes that create files greater than 100 MB**
- ✅ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
  - ✅ `production-quality-gates`
  - ✅ `production-approval`
- ✅ **Require branches to be up to date before merging**
- ✅ **Require conversation resolution before merging**
- ✅ **Dismiss stale PR reviews when new commits are pushed**
- ✅ **Require review from code owners**
- ✅ **Restrict who can dismiss pull request reviews**
- ✅ **Allow specified actors to bypass required pull requests**
  - ❌ **DISABLE THIS - NO BYPASS ALLOWED**
- ✅ **Require signed commits**
- ✅ **Require linear history**
- ✅ **Lock branch** (prevent force pushes)
- ✅ **Do not allow bypassing the above settings**

#### **Manual Deployment Only:**
```yaml
# Production deployments REQUIRE manual trigger:
workflow_dispatch:
  inputs:
    confirmation:
      description: 'Type CONFIRM to deploy'
      required: true
    reason:
      description: 'Deployment reason'
      required: true
```

### **Staging Branch - HIGH SECURITY**

GitHub → Settings → Branches → Add rule for `staging`:

#### **Required Settings:**
- ✅ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
  - ✅ `quality-gates`
- ✅ **Require branches to be up to date before merging**
- ✅ **Require conversation resolution before merging**
- ✅ **Require pull request reviews before merging**
  - Minimum: 1 approval
- ✅ **Restrict pushes that create files greater than 100 MB**

### **Preview Branch - MODERATE SECURITY**

GitHub → Settings → Branches → Add rule for `preview`:

#### **Required Settings:**
- ✅ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
  - ✅ `fast-checks`
- ✅ **Require branches to be up to date before merging**

## 🔄 DEPLOYMENT FLOW

### **Strict Flow Requirements:**
```
Feature Branch → Preview → Staging → Main (Production)
     ↓             ↓         ↓         ↓
   Fast Tests → Full Tests → Manual → CONFIRM Required
```

### **NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED:**
- ❌ **No direct commits to main**
- ❌ **No force push to main or staging**
- ❌ **No bypassing quality gates**
- ❌ **No emergency deployments without approval**

### **Production Deployment Process:**
1. **Merge to staging** → Auto-deploy staging environment
2. **Test staging thoroughly** → Verify all functionality
3. **Create PR staging → main** → Triggers production workflow
4. **Manual approval required** → GitHub environment protection
5. **Type CONFIRM exactly** → Manual workflow trigger only
6. **Provide deployment reason** → Audit trail requirement

## 🚨 EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

### **Critical Hotfix Process:**
1. Create hotfix branch from main
2. Make minimal fix with tests
3. Deploy to preview for verification
4. Fast-track through staging (still requires approval)
5. Emergency production deployment (still requires CONFIRM)

### **Rollback Process:**
1. Identify last known good commit
2. Create rollback PR with explanation
3. Follow normal approval process
4. Emergency deployment if needed

## 🔐 SECURITY ENFORCEMENT

### **Repository Settings:**
- ✅ **Disable force pushes**
- ✅ **Require signed commits**
- ✅ **Enable vulnerability alerts**
- ✅ **Enable automated security fixes**

### **Environment Protection:**
- ✅ **Production environment** requires manual approval
- ✅ **Staging environment** auto-deploys on merge
- ✅ **Preview environment** auto-deploys on push

## 📋 SETUP CHECKLIST

### **GitHub Repository Configuration:**
- [ ] Branch protection rules configured for main
- [ ] Branch protection rules configured for staging  
- [ ] Branch protection rules configured for preview
- [ ] Production environment created with manual approval
- [ ] RAILWAY_TOKEN secret added to repository
- [ ] OPENAI_API_KEY secret added to repository

### **Railway Configuration:**
- [ ] Production service configured (existing)
- [ ] Staging service created and configured
- [ ] Preview service created and configured
- [ ] Environment variables set for all environments

### **Workflow Testing:**
- [ ] Test preview deployment workflow
- [ ] Test staging deployment workflow
- [ ] Test production approval process (without deploying)
- [ ] Verify manual confirmation requirement works

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

✅ **Impossible to deploy to production without typing CONFIRM**
✅ **All quality gates must pass before deployment**
✅ **Manual approval required for production changes**
✅ **Full audit trail for all production deployments**
✅ **Automatic rollback capability if deployment fails**

**REMEMBER: Security is paramount. No shortcuts, no bypasses, no exceptions.**
