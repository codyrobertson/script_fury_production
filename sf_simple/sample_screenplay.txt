THE LAST STAND

FADE IN:

EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY

A long stretch of empty highway cuts through the barren desert. Heat waves shimmer in the distance. A black sedan races down the asphalt at dangerous speeds.

INT. SEDAN - CONTINUOUS

JACK MORRISON (35), rugged and determined, grips the steering wheel. His knuckles are white. In the passenger seat, MARIA SANTOS (28), a brilliant scientist, clutches a metal briefcase.

MARIA
How much time do we have?

JACK
(checking his watch)
Twenty minutes before they realize 
what we've taken.

Maria looks at the briefcase, then out the rear window. A cloud of dust appears on the horizon.

MARIA
They already know.

EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

Three black SUVs emerge from the dust cloud, gaining on the sedan. Sunlight glints off their windshields like predatory eyes.

INT. SEDAN - CONTINUOUS

Jack floors the accelerator. The engine roars in protest.

JACK
Hold on!

He yanks the wheel hard right, tires screaming as they leave the highway and barrel into the desert.

EXT. DESERT TERRAIN - CONTINUOUS

The sedan bounces violently over rocks and sand dunes. The SUVs follow, their powerful engines easily handling the rough terrain.

JACK (V.O.)
Never thought it would end like this.

INT. SEDAN - CONTINUOUS

The briefcase slides around as they hit a particularly rough patch. Maria lunges to catch it.

MARIA
This can't fall into their hands. 
The formula... it could destroy 
everything.

JACK
It won't. I promise you that.

EXT. DESERT TERRAIN - CONTINUOUS

The lead SUV is gaining ground. The passenger window rolls down, revealing a man with a rifle.

GUNMAN
(into radio)
Target acquired. Taking the shot.

He aims at the sedan's rear tire.

BANG!

The sedan spins out of control, rolling twice before coming to rest against a large boulder.

EXT. CRASH SITE - CONTINUOUS

Steam rises from the destroyed sedan. The three SUVs circle like vultures, kicking up clouds of dust.

COMMANDER REEVES (50s), a cold military man, steps out of the lead vehicle. His men take positions around the wreckage.

REEVES
(into radio)
Package secured. Initiating recovery 
protocol.

INT. SEDAN WRECKAGE - CONTINUOUS

Jack slowly regains consciousness. Blood trickles from his forehead. He looks over at Maria, who is unconscious but breathing.

JACK
(whispered)
Maria... wake up.

He reaches for the briefcase, but it's wedged under twisted metal.

EXT. CRASH SITE - CONTINUOUS

Reeves approaches the wreckage, his men flanking him with weapons drawn.

REEVES
Mr. Morrison. Dr. Santos. You've 
caused us quite a bit of trouble.

JACK
(struggling to get out)
The research was never meant for 
weapons.

REEVES
Research has many applications. 
The briefcase, please.

Jack looks at Maria, then at the briefcase. He makes a decision.

JACK
Come and take it.

He pulls out a small device - a detonator.

REEVES
You're bluffing.

JACK
The formula dies with us. That's 
better than letting you weaponize it.

Maria's eyes flutter open. She sees the detonator in Jack's hand.

MARIA
(weakly)
Jack... no.

JACK
I'm sorry, Maria. But some things 
are worth dying for.

He looks at Reeves one last time.

JACK (CONT'D)
And some people aren't worth 
living for.

Jack's thumb moves toward the detonator button.

REEVES
Take them down! Now!

The soldiers raise their weapons, but Jack is faster.

CLICK.

EXT. DESERT - CONTINUOUS

A massive explosion engulfs the crash site. The fireball rises into the clear blue sky like a miniature sun.

The shockwave ripples across the desert, disturbing the eternal silence.

As the smoke clears, nothing remains but scorched earth and the echo of a promise kept.

FADE TO BLACK.

THE END
