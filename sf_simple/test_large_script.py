21 JUMP STREET

FADE IN:

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

JENKO, 22, athletic but not bright, walks through the parking lot. 

SCHMIDT, 22, skinny and nerdy, follows behind with books.

JENKO
This is our chance to be cool.

SCHMIDT
We were never cool in high school.

INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY

PRINCIPAL DAVIS, 50s, looks at their fake IDs.

PRINCIPAL DAVIS
You boys seem a little old for high school.

JENKO
We're... seniors?

EXT. CAFETERIA - DAY

Students ignore them at lunch tables.

SCHMIDT
This isn't going as planned.

INT. CHEMISTRY LAB - DAY

They investigate the drug ring. Test tubes everywhere.

JENKO
What's this stuff?

SCHMIDT
Don't touch anything!

An explosion rocks the lab.

EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

They chase suspects through cars.

JENKO
Police! Stop!

The suspects escape in a sports car.

INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - DAY

CAPTAIN DICKSON, 40s, angry.

CAPTAIN DICKSON
You blew your cover!

SCHMIDT
We can fix this.

EXT. SCHOOL DANCE - NIGHT

Undercover at the prom. Music pumps.

JENKO
There's our target.

They spot the drug dealer, ERIC, 18.

INT. GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

Chase scene through dancing teenagers.

ERIC
You'll never catch me!

SCHMIDT
Watch me!

He tackles Eric into the punch bowl.

EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

Final confrontation with the boss.

BOSS
It's over, cops.

JENKO
Not yet it isn't.

Epic fight scene on the roof.

FADE OUT.
