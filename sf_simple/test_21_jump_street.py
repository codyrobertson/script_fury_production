FADE IN:

EXT. GHETTO STREET - DAY

Two 21-year-old bike patrol officers, JENKO and SCHMIDT, 
cruise down the street. Jenko is tough looking but actually 
pretty dumb. Schmidt is the smart one but insecure about it.

JENKO
(into radio)
21 Jump Street, this is Unit 414.

SCHMIDT
(nervous)
Should we really be doing this?

A DRUG DEALER on the corner spots them.

DRUG DEALER
(shouting)
LAPD! LAPD! Run!

The dealer runs. Various GANG MEMBERS scatter.

GANG MEMBER #1
(yelling)
AAAAAH! The cops!

GANG MEMBER #2
(screaming)
AAAAARGH! Let's go!

JENKO
(to Schmidt)
Come on, let's get them!

They chase the dealer into an alley.

INT. POLICE STATION - LATER

CAPTAIN DICKS, a gruff 50-year-old, addresses the two officers.

CAPTAIN DICKS
You two screwed up big time.

SCHMIDT
(defensive)
We were just trying to help.

JENKO
(confused)
What did we do wrong?

CAPTAIN DICKS
You let the dealer get away because you can't 
work as a team.

A CONCERNED GIRL enters the station.

CONCERNED GIRL
Excuse me, officers. I have information about 
the drug activity.

BLAKEY, a desk sergeant, looks up.

BLAKEY
What kind of information?

CONCERNED GIRL
I saw everything. The dealer was selling to 
high school kids.

FADE OUT.
