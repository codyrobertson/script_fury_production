FADE IN:

EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

JENKO (22), baby-faced but trying to look tough, and SCHMIDT (22), nerdy with glasses, arrive in an old beat-up car.

JENKO
(to Schmidt)
Remember, we're supposed to be cool now.

SCHMIDT
(nervous)
Right. Cool. Got it.

INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

They walk through crowds of STUDENTS. A POPULAR GIRL (17) bumps into Jenko.

POPULAR GIRL
(sarcastic)
Nice car, losers.

She walks away with her FRIENDS (17).

JENKO
(to Schmidt)
That went well.

INT. CHEMISTRY CLASS - LATER

The TEACHER (40s), MR. WALTERS, strict and no-nonsense, addresses the class.

MR. WALTERS
Today we're studying molecular structures.

Schmidt raises his hand enthusiastically. A COOL STUDENT (18) rolls his eyes.

COOL STUDENT
(muttering)
Nerd alert.

EXT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA - LUNCH

Jenko and Schmidt sit alone. A LUNCH LADY (50s) serves them.

LUNCH LADY
(friendly)
You boys are new here, aren't you?

JENKO
Yes ma'am.

Nearby, a group of POPULAR STUDENTS (17-18) including BRAD (18), the school's quarterback, laugh loudly.

BRAD
(to his friends)
Did you see those two losers in the parking lot?

His GIRLFRIEND (17) giggles.

GIRLFRIEND
They're so weird.

INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

The PRINCIPAL (50s), MS. HARDY, addresses Jenko and Schmidt.

MS. HARDY
I trust you'll fit in well here.

A SECRETARY (40s) enters with files.

SECRETARY
Ms. Hardy, you have a call.

FADE OUT.
