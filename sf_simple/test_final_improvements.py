FADE IN:

EXT. NEW YORK CITY - TIMES SQUARE - DAY

The bustling heart of Manhattan. Neon signs flash, tourists snap photos, street performers entertain crowds. DETECTIVE SARAH MARTINEZ (35), Latina, sharp-eyed, walks through the chaos.

SARAH
(into phone)
Captain, I'm at the scene now.

She approaches a crime scene cordoned off with yellow tape.

INT. SUBWAY STATION - PLATFORM - DAY

Underground, fluorescent lights flicker. VICTIM (20s) lies on the platform. FORENSICS TEAM processes evidence.

FORENSICS TECH JENNY
(to Sarah)
Single gunshot wound. Professional job.

SARAH
Any witnesses?

JENNY
One. Homeless man saw everything.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - BENCH - DAY

Sarah sits across from HOMELESS MAN (60s), weathered face, nervous eyes.

HOMELESS MAN
Shooter was tall, dark coat. Had an accent.

SARAH
What kind of accent?

HOMELESS MAN
Eastern European. Maybe Russian.

He hands her a business card.

HOMELESS MAN (CONT'D)
Dropped this when he ran.

Sarah examines the card: "PETROV IMPORTS"

INT. POLICE STATION - BULLPEN - DAY

Busy police station. Phones ringing, detectives at desks. Sarah sits with her partner DETECTIVE MIKE TORRES (40s).

MIKE
Petrov Imports. I've heard that name before.

SARAH
Where?

MIKE
Drug bust last year. They were mentioned but never charged.

Sarah's computer beeps with new information.

SARAH
Got a hit. Viktor Petrov, 52, Russian national.

INT. PETROV'S OFFICE BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY

Elegant marble lobby. Sarah and Mike flash badges to RECEPTIONIST (20s).

RECEPTIONIST
Mr. Petrov is in a meeting.

SARAH
Tell him it's about Alex Volkov.

The receptionist's face changes.

INT. PETROV'S OFFICE - DAY

Floor-to-ceiling windows overlook the harbor. VIKTOR PETROV (50s), immaculate suit, cold eyes, sits behind an enormous desk.

PETROV
Detectives. How may I help you?

SARAH
Alex Volkov. Your employee.

PETROV
Former employee. Tragic what happened.

MIKE
When did you last see him?

PETROV
Last week. He seemed... troubled.

EXT. PETROV'S BUILDING - DAY

Sarah and Mike exit the building.

SARAH
He's lying about something.

MIKE
His alibi checked out. He was in meetings all day.

SARAH
Then someone else did his dirty work.

INT. SARAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Small but neat apartment. Sarah reviews case files spread across her kitchen table. Her phone RINGS.

SARAH
Martinez.

DISTORTED VOICE
Stop investigating Petrov.

SARAH
Who is this?

DISTORTED VOICE
Your only warning.

The line goes dead. Sarah looks out her window - a black sedan is parked across the street.

EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT

Industrial area, dimly lit. Sarah follows a lead, gun drawn. She approaches a warehouse.

INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Dark, empty space. Sarah's flashlight cuts through the darkness. Suddenly, footsteps echo.

VOICE (O.S.)
You should have listened.

Three ARMED MEN emerge from the shadows.

ARMED MAN #1
Mr. Petrov sends his regards.

Sarah dives behind shipping containers as gunfire erupts.

EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Police sirens wail. Multiple police cars arrive. Mike jumps out, gun drawn.

MIKE
(into radio)
Officer down! Need backup and paramedics!

INT. HOSPITAL - SARAH'S ROOM - DAY

Sarah lies in bed, bandaged but alive. Mike sits beside her.

MIKE
Three shooters. All dead. They had no ID.

SARAH
Professional killers.

MIKE
Petrov's alibi still holds. He was at a charity gala.

SARAH
He's untouchable.

MIKE
For now.

INT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

Imposing courthouse steps. Sarah, recovered, walks up with DISTRICT ATTORNEY HELEN CHEN (45).

DA CHEN
The evidence is circumstantial at best.

SARAH
It's enough to get a warrant.

DA CHEN
Petrov's lawyers will challenge everything.

SARAH
Let them try.

INT. PETROV'S OFFICE - DAY

FBI AGENTS storm in with a search warrant. Petrov remains calm as they search.

PETROV
(to his lawyer)
This is harassment.

LAWYER
We'll file a complaint.

Agent finds a hidden safe behind a painting.

FBI AGENT
What's in the safe, Mr. Petrov?

INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

Petrov sits across from Sarah. His lawyer beside him.

SARAH
The safe contained records of illegal arms sales.

PETROV
I have no knowledge of those documents.

SARAH
Your fingerprints are all over them.

PETROV
Planted evidence.

SARAH
Three witnesses saw you at the dock.

Petrov's composure finally cracks.

PETROV
You have nothing!

EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

News crews gather as Petrov is led away in handcuffs.

NEWS REPORTER
Viktor Petrov, alleged arms dealer, has been charged with multiple counts of murder and racketeering.

Sarah watches from the courthouse steps.

SARAH
(to Mike)
Justice served.

MIKE
Finally.

They walk away as camera flashes illuminate the scene.

FADE OUT.
