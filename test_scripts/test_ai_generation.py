FADE IN:

EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

A bustling city street filled with people. JOHN SMITH (30s), a detective in a worn coat, walks quickly through the crowd.

JOHN
(into phone)
I need backup at Fifth and Main. Now.

John reaches into his jacket and pulls out a gun. He looks around nervously.

INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

A dark, empty warehouse. SARAH JOHNSON (20s), a hacker with bright green hair, sits at a computer terminal.

SARAH
(typing furiously)
Come on, come on... Got it!

She turns to face the camera, a smile spreading across her face.

EXT. ROOFTOP - SUNSET

John and Sarah meet on a rooftop overlooking the city. The sun sets behind them.

JOHN
Did you get the files?

SARAH
Everything we need. But we're not alone.

They hear footsteps approaching.

FADE OUT.
